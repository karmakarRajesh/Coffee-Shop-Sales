The Coffee Shop Sales Analyst project involved analyzing sales data from a coffee shop to derive insights and make informed business decisions. Using advanced Excel formulas, I processed and visualized the data, uncovering trends and patterns.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleaned raw sales data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
Organized data into relevant columns (e.g., date, product, quantity, revenue).
Advanced Excel Formulas:
Utilized formulas such as:
SUMIFS to calculate total sales by product category.
PivotTables to summarize sales by month, day, or product.
VLOOKUP to retrieve additional information (e.g., product names).
Visualizations:
Created charts (bar graphs, line charts) to visualize sales trends over time.
Highlighted peak hours, popular products, and seasonal variations.
Business Insights:
Identified top-selling products and low-performing items.
Recommended strategies for inventory management and pricing adjustments.
